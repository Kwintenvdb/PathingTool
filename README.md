# PathingTool
With this tool, you can draw paths within a canvas with just a mouseclick, set an animation duration, and then export the path to Unity. Apply the path to any GameObject to make it smoothly follow along the path over the duration you choose.

The tool is designed using the MVVM pattern, has full undo and redo implementation, supports saving and loading your created paths, as well as an export function to Unity. I wrote a small Unity plugin and script as well, to be able to import the path, and a component that makes a GameObject follow said path.
